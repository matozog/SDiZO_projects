This project implements and analyzes efectivness of optimalization algorithms for problems such as: Travelling Salesman and Knapsack.

Example file for Backpack algorithm look like:
in first line we have: capacity amountOfItems
each of line have: weight_item value_item

Example file for TSP problem look like:
in first line we have number towns
i line has got distance between i towns and j towns, where j is number column

example files is in directory
